# Pokemon GO-like 3D Map Setup

This project implements a Pokemon GO-like 3D map using free open source libraries. Here's what's been implemented:

## 🗺️ Features

- **3D Map with Buildings**: Real 3D buildings using Mapbox GL JS
- **Terrain**: 3D terrain with elevation data
- **Interactive 3D Objects**: Player avatar, collectible items, and building markers
- **Camera Controls**: Smooth camera transitions and 3D navigation
- **Location Services**: Real-time GPS positioning
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Sky rendering and lighting

## 📦 Dependencies Used

- `@rnmapbox/maps` - For the 3D map foundation
- `@react-three/fiber` - For 3D rendering
- `@react-three/drei` - For 3D utilities and helpers
- `expo-location` - For GPS positioning
- `three` - 3D graphics library

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Mapbox Access Token

1. Go to [Mapbox Account](https://account.mapbox.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to the Access Tokens page
4. Copy your access token
5. Replace the token in `config/mapbox.js`:

```javascript
ACCESS_TOKEN: 'your-actual-token-here'
```

**Note**: The current demo token has limitations. Get your own free token for better performance.

### 2. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already in your `package.json`. If you need to reinstall:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
expo start
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Location Permission**: Grant location access when prompted
2. **Map Navigation**: 
   - Pinch to zoom in/out
   - Drag to pan around
   - The map will show 3D buildings and terrain
3. **3D Elements**:
   - Green avatar represents your player
   - Colored items (red pokeballs, purple gems, gold coins) can be collected by tapping
   - Building markers (gyms, pokestops, raids) are shown with colored indicators

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Components

- **`Map3D.jsx`**: Main 3D map component with Mapbox integration
- **`Pokemon3DMarkers.jsx`**: 3D interactive elements and markers
- **`map.jsx`**: Main screen that handles location and camera state

### Key Features

1. **Mapbox Integration**:
   - 3D buildings with realistic heights
   - Terrain elevation data
   - Multiple map styles available
   - Globe projection for better 3D effect

2. **Three.js Overlay**:
   - Player avatar with floating animation
   - Collectible items with rotation and glow effects
   - Building markers with pulsing animations
   - Interactive elements that respond to taps

3. **Camera System**:
   - Smooth transitions between locations
   - 3D perspective with configurable pitch
   - Real-time camera state tracking

## 🎨 Customization

### Map Styles
Change the map style in `config/mapbox.js`:

```javascript
STYLES: {
  STREETS: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v12',
  SATELLITE: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/satellite-v9',
  // ... more styles
}
```

### 3D Settings
Adjust 3D parameters:

```javascript
DEFAULT_ZOOM: 16,           // Map zoom level
DEFAULT_PITCH: 60,          // Camera angle (0 = flat, 90 = vertical)
TERRAIN_EXAGGERATION: 1.5,  // Terrain height multiplier
BUILDING_OPACITY: 0.6       // Building transparency
```

### Adding New 3D Elements
Create new components in `Pokemon3DMarkers.jsx`:

```javascript
const CustomMarker = ({ position }) => {
  return (
    <group position={position}>
      {/* Your 3D geometry here */}
    </group>
  );
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading
- Check your Mapbox access token
- Ensure you have internet connection
- Verify the token has proper permissions

### 3D Elements Not Visible
- Check that Three.js dependencies are installed
- Verify the Canvas component is rendering
- Look for console errors

### Location Not Working
- Grant location permissions
- Check device GPS is enabled
- Try on a physical device (simulator may have issues)

## 📱 Performance Tips

- Use lower zoom levels for better performance
- Limit the number of 3D objects on screen
- Consider using LOD (Level of Detail) for complex models
- Test on physical devices for best results

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add AR support for immersive experience
- Implement multiplayer features
- Add more interactive 3D models
- Create custom map styles
- Add weather effects
- Implement collision detection
